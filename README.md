"one stupid game a week" challenge - 2020/06/06
Unity game; might generously be called a sandbox-style block placing game.  Pick blocks up and place them down elsewhere, in an infinite void full of scattered blocks.

This is not the game I intended to make - it is but a shadow thereof.  I will probably build on this game in weeks to come, hopefully to create the game I *actually* wanted.
